## Overview

**Project Title**:
Dicee App

**Project Description**:
I made an app in Xcode using swift that will pull up an loading page with my name and a logo, It then goes to a page that shows two dice with a button that you can press to roll the dice. The dice are randomized.

**Project Goals**:
My goals were mostly to learn how to use xcode and program a simple app using swift.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download xcode and make sure it is running.
2. Setup a developer account using an Apple ID
3. Make sure your simulator is working
4. Once everything is working all you have to do is run and build the program.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open up the app
2. Press the dice rolling app
3. Enjoy the random numbers generated from the dice

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Xcode

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* Youtube.com (Used to overcome some issues with images not showing up)
* Udemy.com (Found a free course on swift development)
* Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69499754/how-to-use-image-literal-in-xcode-13) Used this site for some image literal help

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Improve the app loading page, for some reason it opens so fast on my phone that you actually don't see it.
* [ ] It might be cool to add an option for how many dice you would like to roll.
